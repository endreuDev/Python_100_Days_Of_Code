<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This folder contains projects from the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 Days of Code</a> course found in Udemy.</p>
<p>Some projects will have different code from the ones found on the course resources with my personal touches and changes, but the functionality is the same.</p>
<p>Inside the 100_Days_Of_Code folder, there is a Data.txt file. It has all the projects' names and the days they were done until now.</p>
